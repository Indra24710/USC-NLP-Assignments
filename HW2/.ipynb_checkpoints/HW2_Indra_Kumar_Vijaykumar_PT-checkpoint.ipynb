    "Its clear from the accuracy results obtained in the sections 5a and 5b that the GRU outperforms the RNN over the given dataset. This could especially be because GRU handles the disadvantages that RNN has such as vanishing gradient problem with its two gate based working. This could enable the GRU to learn long term dependencies between the words which the RNN cannot and thus helps the GRU yield better results than the RNN"
